- [auto commit mode](https://youtu.be/5OdVJbNCSso?si=EDm0IRh8G7KerItn&t=2217)
    - By default auto commit is set to on  
    - Means when we executed some transaction in SQL that transaction is saved
    ```SET AUTOCOMMIT = 0 -- or OFF;```: Disable auto commit, means transactions will not save automatically, we need to manually save by running ``COMMIT`` command
    - `rollback`: Undo the last transaction

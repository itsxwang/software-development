    - Aggregate functions are used to perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.
    - Common aggregate functions include:
        - `COUNT()`: Counts the number of rows in a set.
        - `SUM()`: Calculates the total sum of a numeric column.
        - `AVG()`: Computes the average value of a numeric column.
        - `MIN()`: Finds the minimum value in a set.
        - `MAX()`: Finds the maximum value in a set.

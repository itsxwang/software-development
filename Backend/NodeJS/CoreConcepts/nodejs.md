- [JS On the server](https://youtu.be/AZzV3wZCvI4?si=iaIsg0XlAad8AJNl&t=1727)
    - **DB Management** : So JS on the server can do CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage the data effectively.
    - **Authentication** : Check user is what it claims to be.
    - **Authorization** : Check user has permission to access the resource or do things it trying to do.
    - **Input Valdiation**: Validate the input coming from frontend, to prevent malicious code injection through inputs, and prevent errors.
    - **Session management**: ***Track user activity across various requests to maintain state*** and manage user specific settings.
    - **API Management**: API management is a key aspect of server-side development, where you can build, test, and deploy APIs to handle various tasks and interact with external services or data sources.
    - **Error Handling**: It is important to handle errors in a server-side application to prevent a user from experiencing a broken experience or a server crash.
    - **Security Measures** - Implement **protocols to protect data from unauthorized access** and attacks such as **SQL injection**(this is also prevented by input validation), **cross-site scripting**(XSS). 
    - **Data Encryption** - **Secure sensitive information** by encrypting data stored in DBs and during transmission.
    - **Logging and monitoring** - Keeps records of system activity to **diagnose issue and system health** and security.

So Node.js is one way of creating a server, and then this server can return data like HTML, CSS, JS, JSON, etc. with response, when requests are sent to it.

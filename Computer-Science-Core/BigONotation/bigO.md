- [What is BIgO](https://youtu.be/Mo4vesaut8g?si=rv5RFxNU3zyUvhnG&t=47)
    - Used to analyze efficiency of algorithms as input size grows
    - Focuses on worst-case scenario
    - Ignores constant factors and lower-order terms(terms that become insignificant as input size grows)
    - Common Big O notations:
        - O(1): Constant time 
        - O(log n): Logarithmic time
        - O(n): Linear time
        - O(n log n): Linearithmic time
        - O(n^2): Quadratic time
        - O(2^n): Exponential time
        - O(n!): Factorial time

Examples: 
- If x amount of time a doctor takes to treat one patient, then amount of time taken to treat n patients is O(n)

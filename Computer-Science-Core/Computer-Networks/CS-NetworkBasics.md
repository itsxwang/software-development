# CS Networks 
[Computer networks](https://youtu.be/PhjHXeMNpp8?si=cy35LP7bcs8rLIs9&t=87) are set of different devices and connections between them.  

Networking -> When 2 or more devices comes to exchange data with each other we called it networking. 

- Can be big as Internet or small as just two computers connected with cable.

- Multiple devices like mobile phones, computers, servers, routers, switches, wireless access points, etc. can be connected to each other and form a network.

**IOT (Internet of Things)** is a network of physical devices that are connected to the internet and can collect and exchange data. Examples include smart home devices, wearables, and industrial sensors.

IP (Internet Protocol) is a set of rules that govern how data is sent and received over the internet. It defines how devices communicate with each other and how data is routed between them.

- **IP Address**: A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, allowing it to communicate with other devices. It can be IPv4 (e.g., 192.168.1.1) or IPv6 (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

    - IPV4 adress's each digit(octet) assigned 8 byte (0-255) so in total each IPv4 address is of 32 byte

# [**OSI model**](https://youtu.be/hWIktHvNjeM?si=4v_4IpVYhJl9mViM&t=7)  :
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement network protocols in seven layers. Each layer serves a specific function and communicates with the layers directly above and below it. The seven layers of the OSI model are:
1. **Physical Layer**: This is the lowest layer of the OSI model and is responsible for the physical connection between devices. It deals with the transmission and reception of raw bitstreams over a physical medium, such as cables or wireless signals. Examples include Ethernet cables, fiber optics, and radio waves.
2. **Data Link Layer**: This layer is responsible for establishing a reliable link between two directly connected nodes(e.g., switches and routers). It handles error detection and correction, as well as framing of data packets into frames. Examples include MAC addresses and Ethernet protocols.
3. **Network Layer**: The network layer is responsible for routing data packets between different networks and managing logical addressing. It determines the best path for data to travel from the source to the destination. Examples include IP (Internet Protocol) and routers.
4. **Transport Layer**: This layer is responsible for end-to-end communication and data transfer between devices. It ensures reliable data delivery, error recovery, and flow control. Examples include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for file transfer, etc and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for streaming media, etc.
5. **Session Layer**: The session layer is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating sessions between applications. It provides mechanisms for dialog control (dialog control means managing the communication session) and synchronization. Examples include session management protocols like NetBIOS. In this layer, data start divided into smaller chunks called "segments" for easier management and transmission.
6. **Presentation Layer**: This layer is responsible for data representation and formatting. It ensures that data is presented in a way that is understandable by the application layer. It handles data encryption, compression, and translation. Examples include data formats like JPEG, ASCII, and encryption protocols like SSL/TLS.
7. **Application Layer**: The application layer is the topmost layer of the OSI model and is responsible for providing network services to end-users and applications. It enables communication between software applications and the underlying network. Examples include HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS.

- [Network Switch](https://youtu.be/PhjHXeMNpp8?si=tB7ILRRarnX6ixb7&t=7797)
  - operate on physcial and data link layer
  - Interconnects diff devices using cobber/fiber cable
  - and switches therefore work with PDU of those layers, frames n bits
  - can combine diff type of ports, such as to connect with copper/fiber cable
  - end user ports: used for connections of end user devices to switch
  - uplink ports: used for connections of switch to other switches

- [send frames b/w devices using MAC address](https://youtu.be/PhjHXeMNpp8?si=NRQeWELFiQTJeKN-&t=7917)

- Ports name be like
  - Gi0/1 -> Means switches can transmit up to 1 gigabit of data / sec, in slot 0 and port 1
  - Gi1/2 -> Means switches can transmit up to 1 gigabit of data / sec, in slot 1 and port 2

[Data Integrity](https://youtu.be/ztHopE5Wnpc?si=DKnyt8hgqF-PzhCg&t=3627)


**Data integrity** refers to the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data throughout its entire lifecycle. It ensures that the data remains unchanged and uncorrupted from the moment it is created, stored, or transmitted, until it is accessed or used.

In other words, data integrity guarantees that the data you are working with is exactly the same as the data that was originally created or sent, without any unauthorized modifications, errors, or corruption. 
like example : Even you change the image size or crop it, the hash will be change completely for that image so here hash is helping us to check data integrity . 

Types of Data Integrity
- [Entity Integrity](https://youtu.be/ztHopE5Wnpc?si=wYmn0AOR9gupnK8X&t=3847) 
- [Referential Integrity](https://youtu.be/ztHopE5Wnpc?si=ipbqX-_KWXKdBhWP&t=3987)
- [Domain(Acceptable value for columns) Integrity](https://youtu.be/ztHopE5Wnpc?si=vEhGtAPBBseGc_27&t=4087)

# [Practical Implementing data integrity](https://youtu.be/ztHopE5Wnpc?si=UYzLe9pdcr39XLxH&t=4207)
 
 - Common data types we used in RDBMS are numbers, text, and dates. And these data types allow us to implement **domain integrity**

 - [Foreign key constraints](https://youtu.be/ztHopE5Wnpc?si=9CxGQk2x4xPUUxvE&t=4327) 
    - Foreign key constraints allow us to implement **referential integrity**

- ðŸ‘‰ Primary Key Constraints : Allow us to implement **Entity integrity** in RDBMS
    - Defining a primary key on the table.
    - Ensuring that the primary key cannot be NULL and is unique.

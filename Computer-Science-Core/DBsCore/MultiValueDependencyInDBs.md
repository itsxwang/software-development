A Multivalued Dependency (MVD) is a special kind of dependency that occurs when one attribute in a table determines multiple independent values of another attribute, independently of other attributes.

It's written as:

```
A â‡‰ B 
```

This means:

> For a single value of A, there can be multiple independent values of B.

### âœ… Real-Life Analogy
Imagine a student can have multiple phone numbers and multiple hobbies, but the phone numbers and hobbies are not related to each other.

| StudentID | PhoneNumber | Hobby    |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 101       | 555-1234    | Football |
| 101       | 555-1234    | Music    |
| 101       | 555-5678    | Football |
| 101       | 555-5678    | Music    |

Here:

- `StudentID â‡‰ PhoneNumber`

- `StudentID â‡‰ Hobby`


These are multivalued dependencies, because:
A student has many phones and many hobbies, but neither depends on the other.

### ðŸ“Œ Key Points
- MVDs exist in addition to functional dependencies.

- They violate Fourth Normal Form (4NF).

- If a multivalued dependency exists and it's not a functional dependency, the table should be decomposed to eliminate redundancy.


### ðŸ“‰ Why Are MVDs a Problem?
- They create redundant data and anomalies:
- Insertion anomaly: You must insert all combinations, even if unrelated.
- Deletion anomaly: Deleting a row may delete important unrelated info.


### ðŸ”§ How to Fix It?
Split the table into two separate tables:

Phones Table:
| StudentID | PhoneNumber |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 101       | 555-1234    |
| 101       | 555-5678    |

Hobbies Table:
| StudentID | Hobby    |
| --------- | -------- |
| 101       | Football |
| 101       | Music    |

Now there's no unnecessary duplication.

# 📚 What Are Indexes in Databases?

Indexes in databases are special data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a table — much like an index in a book helps you find a topic faster without scanning every page.

## 🔍 Why Use Indexes?

Without indexes, when you query a database, it may have to scan every row (called a full table scan), which is slow — especially for large datasets.

With an index, the DBMS can quickly locate the rows you're looking for.

## 🛠️ How Indexes Work (Simple Analogy)

**Imagine you have a phone book:**

- Without an index: You search every single name.

- With an index (like alphabetically sorted names): You jump directly to the letter and find your result faster.

In DBs:

- An index is often implemented using B-trees, hash tables, or other structures depending on the type.

## 🧱 Types of Indexes

| Type                    | Description                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single-column Index** | Created on one column.                                        |
| **Composite Index**     | Includes multiple columns (good for multi-condition queries). |
| **Unique Index**        | Ensures all values in the indexed column(s) are unique.       |
| **Clustered Index**     | Physically sorts the table rows (usually one per table).      |
| **Non-Clustered Index** | Keeps a separate structure with pointers to actual rows.      |

## 💡 Example in SQL

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON Employees (LastName);
```

This creates an index on the LastName column of the Employees table, speeding up queries like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE LastName = 'Smith';
```

## ⚠️ Downsides of Indexes

- Takes up disk space
- Slows down INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE (because indexes must also be updated)
- Too many indexes can hurt performance instead of helping

## ✅ Summary

Indexes help you find data faster.
Useful for read-heavy applications.
Should be used strategically, not excessively.

## 🔵 What Is a Clustered Index?

Think of a clustered index as the main order in which data is **physically stored** in the table.

### 📦 Simple Analogy:

Imagine a bookshelf where all the books are arranged alphabetically by title.
That’s like a clustered index on the Title column — the data (books) is physically sorted by title.

### ✅ Key Points:

- There can be only one clustered index per table.
- It determines the order in which rows are stored on disk.
- The actual data rows are stored in that order.

### 📘 Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,  -- This becomes the clustered index
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Age INT
);
```

**Here:**

- **StudentID** is the primary key, and by default it becomes the clustered index.
- So the data rows are stored in order of **StudentID** (1, 2, 3, ...).

## 🟡 What Is a Non-Clustered Index?

A non-clustered index is like a separate list or lookup table that points to where the real data is stored.

### 📦 Simple Analogy:

Imagine a separate index card file sorted by author name.
Each card tells you which shelf and spot the book is on.
That’s a non-clustered index — it doesn’t store the actual data but points to it.

### ✅ Key Points:

- A table can have multiple non-clustered indexes.
- It’s stored separately from the actual data.
- It has a pointer to the row where the real data is.

### 📘 Example:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON Students (Name);
```

**Now:**

- You can quickly find a student by Name.
- The database uses this index to jump to the StudentID row in the actual table.

### 🆚 Clustered vs Non-Clustered
| Feature          | Clustered Index                    | Non-Clustered Index                         |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Storage          | Data is **physically sorted**      | **Separate** from the data                  |
| Number per table | Only **one**                       | Can have **many**                           |
| Fast for         | **Range queries** (like `BETWEEN`) | **Specific lookups** (`WHERE Name = 'Ali'`) |
| Example          | Phone book sorted by names         | Table of contents with page numbers         |

### 🎯 Summary
- Clustered index = data sorted by that column
- Non-clustered index = shortcut that points to the actual data
- You use both to speed up queries, just for different kinds of - lookups

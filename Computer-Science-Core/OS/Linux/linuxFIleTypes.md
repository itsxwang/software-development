## Linux File Types

In Linux, there are seven standard file types. Each type helps identify the nature and purpose of files within the Linux file system:

1. **Regular files**  
    Contain any kind of data, such as text, images, or programs.

2. **Directories**  
    Contain references to other files and directories.

3. **Symbolic links**  
    Special files that point to other files or directories.

4. **FIFO special files (Named pipes)**  
    Allow for inter-process communication.

5. **Block special files**  
    Used for devices that transfer data in blocks (e.g., hard drives).

6. **Character special files**  
    Used for devices that transfer data as a stream of characters (e.g., keyboards, serial ports).

7. **Sockets**  
    Used for inter-process communication over a network.

# The `read` Command in Linux/Unix

The `read` command is a shell built-in used to read input from stdin (usually the keyboard, but can be redirected) and store it in shell variables. Itâ€™s commonly used in shell scripts for user input, parsing data, or processing redirected input.

---

## What is the `read` Command?

- **Purpose:** Reads a line from stdin and assigns it to one or more variables.
- **Shell:** Primarily used in Bash, Zsh, and other POSIX-compliant shells.

### Syntax

```bash
read [options] [variable1] [variable2] ...
```

---

## Key Features and Options

- **Basic Usage:** Reads a single line and stores it in a variable (default: `REPLY` if no variable is specified).
- **Common Options:**
    - `-p "prompt"`: Displays a prompt before reading input (Bash-specific).
    - `-r`: Prevents backslash escaping (raw input, recommended for most cases).
    - `-s`: Silent mode (hides input, useful for passwords).
    - `-n num`: Reads only `num` characters instead of a full line.
    - `-d delim`: Uses `delim` as the delimiter instead of a newline.
    - `-t timeout`: Sets a timeout (seconds) for input.
    - `-a`: Reads into an array (Bash-specific).
- **Input Source:** Reads from stdin, which can be the keyboard, a file, or piped data.

## Basic Examples

### Reading User Input

```bash
read -p "Enter your name: " name
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

**Example output:**
```
Enter your name: Alice
Hello, Alice!
```

---

### Reading Without a Variable

```bash
read
echo $REPLY
```
Stores input in the default variable `REPLY`.

---

### Reading Multiple Variables

```bash
read first second
# Input: Alice Bob
```
Assigns `Alice` to `first`, `Bob` to `second`.

---

## Stdin Redirection with `read`

### From a File

```bash
read line < input.txt
echo "First line: $line"
```
Reads the first line of `input.txt` into `line`.

> **Note:** `read` only processes one line at a time unless looped.

---

### From a Pipe

```bash
echo "Alice 25" | read name age
echo "Name: $name, Age: $age"
# Output: Name: Alice , Age: 25
```
> **Note:** When using pipes, variables may not persist in the parent shell (see "Subshell Issue" below).

---

### Reading a File Line-by-Line

```bash
while read -r line; do
        echo "Line: $line"
done < input.txt
```
Reads each line of `input.txt` into `line` until EOF.

---

## Advanced Examples

### Silent Input (e.g., Password)

```bash
read -s -p "Enter password: " pass
echo -e "\nPassword stored."
```
Hides typed characters (useful for sensitive input).

---

### Custom Delimiter

```bash
read -d ',' name <<< "Alice,Bob"
echo $name
# Output: Alice
```
Reads up to `,` into `name`.

---

### Reading into an Array

```bash
read -a colors <<< "red blue green"
echo ${colors[1]}
# Output: blue
```
Second element of the array.

---

### Timeout

```bash
read -t 5 -p "Enter input (5s): " input || echo "Timed out"
```
Waits 5 seconds; if no input, prints "Timed out".

---

## Key Notes

- **IFS (Internal Field Separator):** Controls how input is split into variables. Default is whitespace (`IFS=" \t\n"`).

    ```bash
    IFS=: read user pass <<< "alice:secret"
    # user=alice, pass=secret
    ```

- **Subshell Issue:** When using pipes (`|`), `read` runs in a subshell, so variables may not persist in the parent shell. Workaround:

    ```bash
    read name age < <(echo "Alice 25")
    ```

- **Use `-r`:** Prevents issues with backslashes (e.g., `read -r` treats `\n` as literal `\n`).
- **Exit Status:** Returns 0 on success, non-zero on EOF or error.

---

## Practical Use Cases

- **Interactive Scripts:** Prompt users for input (e.g., names, choices).
- **Parsing Files:** Process configuration files or logs line-by-line.
- **Piped Data:** Handle output from other commands (e.g., `ps | read`).
- **Secure Input:** Use `-s` for passwords or sensitive data.

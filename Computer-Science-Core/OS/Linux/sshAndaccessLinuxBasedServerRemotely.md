### ***SSH***(Secure Shell) connection is used to access linux based server remotely, in that we can do configuration on remote machine without physical connection and can do many more things.

- There are various ways to access linux based server remotely.

    - first: `systemctl start ssh` this will start the ssh server on your machine
        - Your system is now ready to accept incoming SSH connections (like from another machine).
        - This is not a client-side SSH connection â€” it's a service/daemon that listens on port 22.

    - second: `ssh username@ipaddress`
    - then to check if it is connected you can use `w` or `who` command 
      - this Shows who is logged in and from where.
    - You should see your current SSH session in the output with the IP of machine you are connected to.

    - `echo $SSH_CONNECTION`
    - This environment variable is set only in SSH sessions.
    - It will output something like:\
     `192.168.29.XX 52846 192.168.29.75 22`\
     (client-IP, client-port, server-IP, server-port)

    - Exit from ssh session    
        - ***use `exit`*** to close the ssh session or `Ctrl+D`
        - âœ… 3. Force kill the connection (only if needed)
            - If the session hangs or becomes unresponsive, in another terminal you can:
                ```bash
                pkill ssh
                ```
            - Or, from the local machine:
                ```bash
                ps aux | grep ssh
                ```
                `- ps` means "process status".\
                `- a` means show processes for all users.\
                `- u`  show process owner/user and other details. \
                 `- x` include processes not attached to a terminal (like background daemons or SSH).\
                 `- |` pipe: takes the output of `ps aux` and sends it as input to the next command.\
                `- grep ssh`  filters the output to only show lines containing "ssh".
                
                - Now Get the process ID (PID) of an SSH session, from this type of output:
                ```USER     PID  %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND```


                Find the SSH process and use `kill PID`. E.g: ```kill 3523```
        - ðŸ§  Pro tip:
After disconnecting, your prompt will switch back to your local machine's terminal â€” a good indicator that you're no longer connected to the remote one.

    - The ssh service is designed to be run in the background, so you don't have to close it. But if you still wanna close, consider this : 
    - `systemctl stop ssh`\
        This will:
        - Immediately stop the SSH server.

        - Disconnect any active SSH sessions.

        - Block any new SSH connection attempts.

    - Useful commands summary: 
        ```
            | Action                  | Command                      |
            | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
            | Start SSH server        | `sudo systemctl start ssh`   |
            | Stop SSH server         | `sudo systemctl stop ssh`    |
            | Restart SSH server      | `sudo systemctl restart ssh` |
            | Check SSH server status | `sudo systemctl status ssh`  |
            | Enable on boot          | `sudo systemctl enable ssh`  |
            | Disable on boot         | `sudo systemctl disable ssh` |
        ```
        `sytemctl stop ssh.socket` also stop listening on port 22 for any ssh connection attempt, and not start ssh connection even on ssh attempt.  
        So even if you stop the ssh.service(using ```systemctl stop ssh``` or ```systemctl stop ssh.service```) but not close the **ssh.socket**, the ssh.socket is still listening on port 22 and will re-activate ssh.service on demand.

        *This is a systemd feature called "socket activation", which helps save resources by only running services when needed.*

To connect via SSH or use scp(secure copy protocol) without entering a password every time.
This is achieved using SSH key-based authentication.

## âœ… 1. `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`
`-t` specify the type of key to generate.\
This command generates a **new SSH key pair** on your system.
**What it does**:
- Creates two files:
    - Private key â†’ `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
    - Public key â†’ `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
- The private key stays secret on your machine.
- The public key is something you can share with others (or remote servers).

Why **ed25519** type key?
- Itâ€™s faster and more secure than older RSA keys.
- Shorter in size but strong in encryption. 

Output example:
```shell
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/yourname/.ssh/id_ed25519): [Press Enter]
Enter passphrase (optional): [Press Enter or type one]
```
- What is passphrase? \
    - A passphrase is like a password for your private key.
    - It adds an extra layer of security on top of your key pair.
    - âœ… If you type a passphrase:
      - Your private key (in `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`) gets encrypted with that passphrase. 
      - Every time you use this key (e.g., to SSH or SCP), you'll be asked to type the passphrase to decrypt it and use it.
    - ðŸ’¡ This protects your key even if someone steals your file (`id_ed25519`). They canâ€™t use it without your passphrase.
    - ðŸš« If you press Enter (leave it empty):
        - The key is not protected by a passphrase.

        - SSH will not prompt for anything â€” it will just use the key.

        - Itâ€™s more convenient, but less secure.
    - This is OK if:
        - Youâ€™re the only user on the machine.

        - You have disk encryption.

        - Itâ€™s for automation/scripts where typing a passphrase every time isn't practical.
    - So if you enter a passphrase, you should remember it. As it will ask everytime you will do ssh or scp. You can use `ssh-agent` to cache the passphrase, ask gpt how to do that. 

## âœ… 2. `ssh-copy-id username@remoteMachineIp`
This command installs your public key on the remote machine (192.168.29.75) under the xion user. Only if you have ssh access to the remote machine. And that's why you should always secure your username and password, so only trusted users can use `ssh-copy-id`.

What it does:
- Copies your public key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub)` to the remote machine.
- Adds it to `~xion/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote system.
- This means the remote SSH server now trusts your private key to log in.

What happens on the remote machine:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub >> /home/xion/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
âœ… Now what?
After this setup:

- When you do:
```bash
ssh username@remoteMachineIp
```
- Instead of asking for a password, your system sends the private key.

- The remote machine verifies it using the authorized public key.

- If it matches, you're in â€” no password needed!

### ðŸ§  How It Works Internally (Simplified)
1. SSH client tries to connect to ex: 192.168.29.75.

2. Server says: "Do you have a key I recognize?"

3. Client sends a signature made using your private key(`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).

4. Server uses the stored public key to verify it.

5. If valid â†’ access granted. âœ…

`authorized_keys` -> Is a file in `~/.ssh/` on the remote machine, that lists trusted public keys(one public key per line)(when you use `ssh-copy-id` command you add your public key to this file in remote machine).

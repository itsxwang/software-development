- It is designed to be a modern replacement for WebGL, providing better performance and more direct access to GPU features.
- WebGPU is based on the Vulkan API and is supported by major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, etc. 

- GPU is designed for parallel processing, making it well-suited for tasks like graphics rendering and machine learning, on the other hand, CPU is optimized for [sequential processing](https://youtu.be/oAwlk0j5RUM?si=4QEUv07DSqN8Xs5W&t=207) and general-purpose computing.

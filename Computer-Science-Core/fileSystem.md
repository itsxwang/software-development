Concrete format or program for storing files and directories on a data storage device

Can One data storage device can have multiple file systems?

Yes, a single storage device can have multiple filesystems. This is typically achieved by creating multiple partitions on the device, each formatted with a different filesystem. For example, one partition can be formatted with ext4, another with NTFS, and another with FAT32, allowing the device to be used across different operating systems.

In some cases, it is theoretically possible to have multiple filesystems on a single partition, but this is not common and requires careful configuration. For instance, it is possible to have two filesystems at the beginning of a partition, mounting at most one at a time, and specifying the filesystem type when mounting.
 However, this approach is not practical for most users and can lead to data loss if not handled correctly.

Additionally, some advanced file systems like ZFS support multiple filesystems sharing a common pool of free blocks, allowing for greater flexibility without reserving a fixed amount of space for each filesystem.

In summary, while it is possible to have multiple filesystems on a single storage device, the most common and practical approach is to use multiple partitions, each with its own filesystem.

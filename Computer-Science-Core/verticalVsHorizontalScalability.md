# Vertical vs Horizontal scalability

First, Scalability: In the computer world, ***scalability*** refers to a system's ability to handle growing amounts of work or to be expanded to accommodate that growth. There are two main types:

## üîπ Vertical Scalability (Scaling Up)
### Definition:
Increasing the capacity of a single machine (server) by adding more resources such as CPU, RAM, or faster storage.

Example:

- Upgrading your server from 8 GB RAM to 64 GB RAM.
- Replacing a 4-core CPU with a 32-core CPU.

Pros:
- Simpler to implement (no changes in application architecture needed).
- No complex coordination needed between machines.

Cons:
- There is a limit to how much you can scale up.
- Downtime may be required to upgrade.
- Can be more expensive per unit of performance.

## üîπ Horizontal Scalability (Scaling Out)
### Definition:
Increasing capacity by adding more machines (nodes) to a system, distributing the load across multiple computers.   

Example:

- Running your app on multiple servers behind a load balancer.

- Adding more database shards or caching servers.

Pros:
- Virtually unlimited scalability (add more machines as needed).

- High availability and fault tolerance.

- Better suited for distributed systems like microservices, NoSQL DBs, etc.

Cons:

- Requires changes in software architecture.

- More complex management and communication between nodes.

### Viruses

Viruses are one of the oldest and most well-known types of malware. They are malicious programs designed to attach themselves to legitimate files or programs and replicate by infecting other files on the same system or across systems. The term "virus" comes from their biological analogy—they spread by "infecting" hosts.

#### How Viruses Work
- **Infection Mechanism**: A virus typically embeds its code into executable files (like .exe files), documents (e.g., Word or PDF macros), or boot sectors of storage devices. When the infected file is executed or opened, the virus activates and infects other files.
- **Replication and Spread**: Viruses require user interaction to spread, such as opening an infected email attachment, downloading a compromised file, or inserting an infected USB drive. Once active, they can modify system files, corrupt data, or deliver additional payloads like stealing information.
- **Payload Delivery**: Beyond replication, viruses often carry a "payload"—harmful actions like deleting files, displaying messages, or installing backdoors. Some are dormant until triggered by a specific date or event (e.g., time bombs).
- **Types of Viruses**:
  - **File Infectors**: Attach to executable files and spread when the file is run.
  - **Boot Sector Viruses**: Infect the master boot record (MBR) of hard drives or USBs, activating during boot-up.
  - **Macro Viruses**: Use scripting languages in applications like Microsoft Office (e.g., VBA macros) to infect documents.
  - **Polymorphic Viruses**: Change their code signature each time they replicate to evade detection.
  - **Metamorphic Viruses**: Rewrite their entire code while keeping functionality intact, making them harder to detect.

#### Examples
- **CIH (Chernobyl Virus)**: Overwrote BIOS chips and hard drive data, rendering systems unbootable.
- **Melissa**: A macro virus that spread via email in 1999, overwhelming servers.
- **ILOVEYOU**: Spread through email attachments in 2000, overwriting files and stealing passwords.

#### Impact and Detection
- **Effects**: Data loss, system crashes, performance degradation, or escalation to more severe attacks.
- **Detection and Prevention**: Antivirus software scans for known signatures or behavioral anomalies. Use email filters, avoid suspicious downloads, keep software updated, and enable macro security in apps.
- **Historical Note**: The first computer virus, "Creeper," appeared in 1971 on ARPANET, but modern viruses surged in the 1980s with PCs.

### Worms

Worms are self-replicating malware that spread independently across networks without needing to attach to files or require user interaction. Unlike viruses, they don't modify host files but exploit vulnerabilities to propagate.

#### How Worms Work
- **Infection Mechanism**: Worms scan for vulnerable systems on a network (e.g., via open ports or weak passwords) and copy themselves over. They often use email, instant messaging, or file-sharing protocols.
- **Replication and Spread**: Once on a system, a worm creates copies and sends them to other devices. This can lead to exponential growth, clogging networks with traffic.
- **Payload Delivery**: Worms may install backdoors, launch DDoS attacks, or steal data. Some are designed purely for disruption.
- **Types of Worms**:
  - **Network Worms**: Exploit OS vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows).
  - **Email Worms**: Spread via email attachments or links.
  - **Instant Messaging Worms**: Use chat apps to send infected messages.
  - **File-Sharing Worms**: Disguise as popular files on P2P networks.

#### Examples
- **Code Red**: In 2001, exploited Microsoft IIS servers, defacing websites and launching DDoS attacks.
- **Conficker**: Infected millions of Windows machines in 2008 by exploiting network shares and weak passwords, creating a massive botnet.
- **WannaCry**: While primarily ransomware, it had worm-like propagation via EternalBlue exploit in 2017.

#### Impact and Detection
- **Effects**: Network slowdowns, bandwidth exhaustion, data breaches, or botnet formation.
- **Detection and Prevention**: Firewalls to block unauthorized traffic, regular patching of software vulnerabilities, strong passwords, and intrusion detection systems (IDS). Antivirus can catch known worms.

### Trojans

Trojans (short for Trojan horses) are deceptive malware that masquerade as legitimate software to trick users into installing them. They don't replicate like viruses or worms but rely on social engineering for entry.

#### How Trojans Work
- **Infection Mechanism**: Delivered via email attachments, fake software downloads, drive-by downloads from malicious sites, or bundled with freeware. Once executed, they appear harmless (e.g., a game or utility) while performing malicious actions in the background.
- **Payload Delivery**: Trojans create backdoors for remote access, log keystrokes, steal credentials, or download additional malware. They can also hijack system resources for cryptomining.
- **Types of Trojans**:
  - **Backdoor Trojans**: Allow unauthorized remote control (e.g., RATs—Remote Access Trojans).
  - **Downloader Trojans**: Fetch and install other malware.
  - **Banking Trojans**: Target financial data, like modifying online banking sessions.
  - **DDoS Trojans**: Turn devices into bots for distributed denial-of-service attacks.
  - **FakeAV Trojans**: Pretend to be antivirus software while infecting the system.

#### Examples
- **Zeus (Zbot)**: A banking Trojan that stole login credentials via keylogging and form grabbing.
- **Emotet**: Started as a banking Trojan but evolved into a malware distributor, spreading via spam emails.
- **CryptoJackers**: Trojans like Coinhive that mine cryptocurrency without user consent.

#### Impact and Detection
- **Effects**: Data theft, unauthorized access, financial loss, or system compromise.
- **Detection and Prevention**: Scan downloads with antivirus, avoid clicking unknown links, use ad blockers, and enable two-factor authentication (2FA). Behavioral analysis in security software helps spot anomalies.

### Ransomware

Ransomware is malware that encrypts files or locks systems, demanding payment (usually cryptocurrency) for decryption keys. It's highly profitable for cybercriminals and has evolved into sophisticated attacks.

#### How Ransomware Works
- **Infection Mechanism**: Enters via phishing emails, exploit kits, RDP vulnerabilities, or malicious ads (malvertising). Some variants spread worm-like across networks.
- **Encryption Process**: Uses strong algorithms (e.g., AES or RSA) to encrypt files, appending extensions like .locked or .crypt. It may also delete backups or shadow copies.
- **Ransom Demand**: Displays a ransom note with payment instructions, often via Tor networks. Payments don't guarantee decryption, and some strains exfiltrate data for double extortion.
- **Types of Ransomware**:
  - **Encryptors**: Lock files (e.g., CryptoLocker).
  - **Lockers**: Lock the entire device or screen.
  - **Leakware/Doxware**: Threaten to publish stolen data.
  - **RaaS (Ransomware-as-a-Service)**: Kits sold on dark web for affiliates to customize.

#### Examples
- **CryptoLocker**: In 2013, used RSA-2048 encryption and demanded Bitcoin.
- **WannaCry**: Global outbreak in 2017, exploiting Windows SMB vulnerability, affecting hospitals and businesses.
- **REvil (Sodinokibi)**: Targeted enterprises, demanding millions; involved in Kaseya supply chain attack in 2021.

#### Impact and Detection
- **Effects**: Data inaccessibility, financial extortion, operational downtime (e.g., halted medical services).
- **Detection and Prevention**: Regular backups (offline or air-gapped), antivirus with ransomware protection, patch management, email filtering, and user training. Tools like Windows Controlled Folder Access help. Never pay ransoms, as it funds crime.

### Spyware

Spyware is stealthy malware that secretly monitors user activity and collects sensitive information without consent. It's often used for surveillance, advertising, or identity theft.

#### How Spyware Works
- **Infection Mechanism**: Bundled with free software, installed via drive-by downloads, or through phishing. It runs in the background, evading detection.
- **Data Collection**: Tracks keystrokes, screenshots, browsing history, emails, or webcam/microphone feeds. Data is sent to remote servers.
- **Payload Delivery**: May alter browser settings (e.g., homepage hijacking) or install adware. Advanced spyware can persist through reboots.
- **Types of Spyware**:
  - **Keyloggers**: Record keystrokes to capture passwords.
  - **Adware (a subset)**: Displays unwanted ads based on browsing data.
  - **Stalkers**: Monitor personal communications.
  - **Commercial Spyware**: Legitimate tools like parental controls that can be abused (e.g., Pegasus).

#### Examples
- **FinSpy (FinFisher)**: Government-grade spyware for surveilling activists.
- **CoolWebSearch**: Browser hijacker from the early 2000s.
- **Pegasus**: iOS/Android spyware developed by NSO Group, exploiting zero-days.

#### Impact and Detection
- **Effects**: Privacy invasion, identity theft, targeted ads, or blackmail.
- **Detection and Prevention**: Anti-spyware tools (e.g., Malwarebytes), browser privacy extensions, avoid shady downloads, and regular system scans. Use VPNs for added privacy.

### Additional Malware Types

Beyond the ones listed, here are other significant types in full detail:

#### Adware
- **Description**: Displays unwanted advertisements, often aggressively, to generate revenue. It's less harmful than others but can slow systems and track users.

- **Prevention**: Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, script blocking.

#### Polymorphic/Metamorphic Malware
- **Description**: Changes code to avoid signature-based detection while maintaining function.
- **How It Works**: Uses mutation engines to alter appearance per infection.
- **Examples**: Storm Worm (polymorphic email worm).
- **Impact**: Evasion of security.
- **Prevention**: Heuristic/behavioral analysis in antivirus.

#### Logic Bombs
- **Description**: Dormant code triggered by specific events (e.g., date or user action).
- **How It Works**: Embedded in legitimate software; activates to delete data or crash systems.
- **Examples**: Siemens insider attack (planted in SCADA systems).
- **Impact**: Targeted sabotage.
- **Prevention**: Code audits, access controls.

In summary, malware evolves rapidly with cyber threats, blending types (e.g., trojan-ransomware hybrids). General defenses include reputable antivirus, updates, backups, caution with unknowns, and multi-layered security (e.g., firewalls, MFA). For the latest threats, monitoring sources like MITRE ATT&CK or cybersecurity reports is advisable.

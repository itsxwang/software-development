"""
We can use `__new__` dunder method to implement the Singleton pattern in Python.   
The `__new__` method is a special method responsible for creating a new instance of a class.
It is called before the `__init__` method and is used to control the creation of a new instance.
The `__new__` method is a static method (though it doesn't need to be explicitly decorated as such)
and takes the class as its first argument, followed by any additional arguments that are passed
to the class constructor.

# both instances Singleton(10) and Singleton(20) pointing to the same object in the memory , because of our logic we write in __new__ above
# that's why `value` attribute is shared between both variables , and the value now becomes 20 as `singleton2.value = 20` runs in __init__ , when `singleton2` object is created

# Both instances are the same (Singleton pattern ensures only one instance exists)
print(singleton1 is singleton2)  # Output: True

# The value is shared between instances because they are the same object in the memory , and we already know `singleton2` object creation updates the value of `value` attribute

print(singleton2.value)  # Output: 20

# Now if we do , as both variables are pointing to same object therefore singleton2.value also == 77

"""
Key Points:
- `__new__` is called to create a new instance of the class.
- It must return an instance of the class (or a subclass).
- If `__new__` does not return an instance of the class, the `__init__` method will not be called.
- `__new__` is often used in cases where you need to control the creation of immutable objects,
  implement singletons, or customize instance creation.

When to Use `__new__`:
- Immutable Objects: When working with immutable objects like tuples or strings, you might need
  to override `__new__` to customize instance creation.
- Singleton Pattern: To ensure that only one instance of a class exists.
- Custom Instance Creation: When you need to control how instances are created, such as returning
  instances of a different class or modifying the instance before it is returned.

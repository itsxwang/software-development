# [useDeferredValue Hook](https://youtu.be/jCGMedd6IWA?si=_K5wCGascApVN2Iu)


## Overview

The `useDeferredValue` hook in React helps improve performance by deferring updates to a value, so that expensive UI components don't re-render as frequently as the value changes. This is especially useful for components that receive frequent updates, such as search inputs.

---

## Purpose

- **`useDeferredValue`** delays updates to a value.
- Components using the deferred value re-render less often than those using the original value.

---

## Syntax

```jsx
const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value);
```
- **`value`**: The current value you want to defer.
- **`deferredValue`**: The throttled/deferred version of `value`.

---

## Real-world Example

Imagine a search input that filters a large list. You want the input to stay responsive, but the list can update slightly later to save resources.

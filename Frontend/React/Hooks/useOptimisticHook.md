## ‚úÖ Part 1 [What are **Optimistic** updates?](https://youtu.be/M3mGY0pgFk0?si=uWg2ADlmsSG-HnTT&t=27)

**Optimistic updates** are a UI technique where the interface is updated immediately as if an operation (such as form submission or data mutation) has already succeeded, even before receiving a server response.

### üîÅ Why Use Optimistic Updates?

- **Improves user experience:** The app feels faster and more responsive.
- **Reduces perceived latency:** Users see the result of their actions immediately.
- **Common in apps like:**
  - Twitter (posting a tweet)
  - Trello (moving a card)
  - Instagram (liking a photo)

### üîß How It Works

1. **User triggers an action** (e.g., adds a comment).
2. **UI immediately reflects the change** (the comment appears in the list).
3. **A network request is sent** in the background to persist the change.
4. **If the request succeeds:** Nothing changes.
5. **If the request fails:** Roll back the optimistic update and show an error.

# [`<Suspense>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense)
 lets you display a fallback until its children have finished loading.


## 🚧 What does "suspend" mean in React?
In React, "suspend" means:
> ❗ Pause rendering a component because something (like data or code) isn’t ready yet.

React will temporarily stop rendering that part of the UI and show a fallback UI (like a spinner) until it becomes ready.

## 🔁 Why would React "suspend"?
### React suspends when:
1. You lazy load a component
2. You fetch data asynchronously
3. You use concurrent features like `useTransition` or `useDeferredValue`


## 🔸 Example 1: Lazy Component (code splitting)

- App.jsx
```jsx
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';

const Profile = lazy(() => import('./Profile'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading profile...</p>}>
      <Profile />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

- Profile.jsx
```jsx
// Simulate a 2-second loading delay
function wait(ms) {
  const start = Date.now();
  while (Date.now() - start < ms) {}
}

function Profile() {
  wait(2000); // This blocks for 2 seconds (not good in real apps, but fine for demo)

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Profile Component</h2>
      <p>This content appeared after 2 seconds!</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Profile;
```

- `Profile` is loaded dynamically (not immediately).

- React sees it’s not ready and says, “Wait! I’ll suspend this rendering.”

- It shows `<p>Loading profile...</p>`(fallback UI) instead.

- When the file finishes loading, React re-renders(the Suspense boundary — meaning everything inside `<Suspense>`) and shows the real component instead of fallback UI.

---

What happens if we import `Profile` component normally ??
This happens: 
### At build time:

- **Webpack or Vite bundles everything together.**(***BTW it happens in above case also***)

- `Profile` is eagerly loaded — it's part of the main JavaScript bundle.

- So it's immediately available when your app loads.

### At runtime (browser):

- React renders <App />.

- Inside <App />, it directly renders <Profile />.

- Since Profile has a blocking wait(2000) function (bad practice!), the main thread is blocked for 2 seconds before the DOM updates.

### Result:

- You see a blank screen (or frozen UI) for 2 seconds.

- After that, the <Profile /> content appears.


### 🚫 What's the downside of normal import here?
- **No code-splitting** — The Profile code is included even if it’s not used right away.

- **Bad user experience** — Because of `wait(2000)`, the UI becomes unresponsive for 2 seconds. No fallback UI shows.

- **No fallback** — Unlike `<Suspense>`, React can’t show "Loading..." while blocking logic runs.

### ✅ When should you use lazy + Suspense?

***Use `React.lazy` + `Suspense` when:***

- You want code-splitting (load components only when needed).

- You want to show fallback UIs while waiting.

- You want to avoid blocking the main thread.

Summary:

| Import Type                                       | Profile Available | UI Blocking?  | Fallback UI? | Code Splitting |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| `import Profile from './Profile'`                 | Immediately       | ✅ Yes (2 sec) | ❌ No         | ❌ No           |
| `const Profile = lazy(() => import('./Profile'))` | After load        | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes        | ✅ Yes          |

## Caveats of Suspense explained:

### 🔷 1. "React does not preserve any state for renders that got suspended before they were able to mount for the first time."

👉 **What it means:**:
If a component is still loading (e.g., waiting for lazy loading or data) and it has not rendered for the first time, React won’t remember any state or effects from it. If it suspends, React will retry from scratch.

```jsx
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent'));
```

If **HeavyComponent** is not yet loaded, and suspends (because it's lazy), React does not keep any internal state or effect of that component yet. When it's ready, React re-renders it as if it’s the first time.



### 🔷 2. "If Suspense was displaying content for the tree, but then it suspended again, the fallback will be shown again..."   

#### 👉 What it means:
Let’s say a component successfully rendered once under `<Suspense>`. If it suspends again, React will go back to showing the fallback UI.

- 💥 Exception:
> ...unless the update that caused the suspension was triggered by startTransition() or useDeferredValue().

That’s because transitions are considered non-urgent — so React won’t throw the user back to the loading spinner.

### 🔷 3. "If React needs to hide already visible content because it suspended again..."

#### What happens next:
If React has to hide content that was already visible (due to suspension again), it will:

- 🔄 Clean up layout effects (those from useLayoutEffect)

- ⏳ Wait for data/component

- ✅ Re-run layout effects once content is ready

#### 🔍 Why this matters:
Because layout effects (like measuring DOM size or scrolling to an element) must run on visible content. React ensures they don't run on invisible/unmounted content.

### 🔷 4. React has behind-the-scenes performance optimizations (Streaming SSR, Selective Hydration)

#### 🧠 Just remember:
- `Suspense` isn’t just for client-side code.

- It integrates with Streaming Server Rendering (SSR) for faster page loads.

- Selective Hydration lets React hydrate only the parts of the page that are visible/interacted with, improving performance.

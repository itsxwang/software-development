***System programming*** involves developing software that manages and controls a computer's hardware and resources, allowing it to function effectively as a single unit. It's distinct from application programming, which focuses on building user-facing applications. System programmers work on low-level code, often using languages like C or other low level languages(like zig, rust, c++).   

## Key Aspects of System Programming:

### Focus on System Resources:
System programming deals with managing memory, processors, devices and other system resources. 

### Low-Level Programming:
It often involves working directly with hardware and machine languages, requiring a deeper understanding of the system architecture. 

### System Software Development:
System programmers develop software like operating systems, compilers, linkers, device drivers, etc... 

### Optimization and Efficiency:
The goal is to create software that is highly efficient, with minimal runtime overhead, and can operate effectively in resource-constrained environments. 

### Abstraction and APIs:
System programs often provide abstractions and APIs to simplify application development

### System Calls: 
System programming heavily relies on system calls, which are function invocations from user space to the kernel

### Tools and Techniques:
Systems programmers use tools like debuggers, profilers, and source version control systems to develop and maintain complex systems. 

### Examples of System Programming:
- Embedding systems (e.g., microcontrollers, IoT devices).
- Writing device drivers that allow the operating system/applications to interact - with hardware or peripheral devices.
- Developing operating systems (e.g., Linux, macOS, Windows).
- Developing network software, embedding systems software and database management systems. 
- Creating compilers and interpreters.
- Developing virtual machines and emulators.
- Developing operating system kernels.

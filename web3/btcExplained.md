- TimeStamp Server: In blockchain, each block contains a timestamp(this includes the date, time, and timezone) and a link to the previous block, forming a chain. This ensures that the data in the 
blocks cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks, providing security and integrity to the blockchain.
\
**Timestamp server** is a way to prove that a piece of data existed at a certain point in time. It works by taking a hash of the data and publishing it in a public place, such as a newspaper or a website. This creates a permanent record that can be used to verify the existence of the data at that time.


- **Proof of Work**: Proof of Work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism used in blockchain networks to validate transactions and create new blocks. It requires participants (miners) to solve complex mathematical puzzles, which requires significant computational power and energy. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the new block to the blockchain and is rewarded with cryptocurrency. This process ensures the security and integrity of the blockchain by making it difficult and costly to alter past transactions.

- [Combining and splitting value section](https://youtu.be/NoqNhWnjE1Q?si=5uAt6xaux5wwTFzd&t=147), in this section it explains how transactions can have multiple inputs and outputs, allowing for more complex transactions and better privacy.
